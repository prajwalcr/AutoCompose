A new-born lambkin from the past was born:
Red as a ripe cherry; white as a cherry;
Bright as the lily in the garden;
Flecked with lilies the new-born lambkin came;
But still she was old, as the lily is:
And yet she was beautiful, for the new born lambkin
In the garden was not so old.

Thy soul has joy, and thy soul is free,
And all the things it loves can live
In thy love for me and thee!
O gentle-throat, why sing so low,
Or do thy music too loudly?
Whence are all thy numbers fit?
If that thy mind is fix'd upon one,
It joys not to hear thee speak.

Oh, the heart that thrills with the sweet pain
Of losing her loveliness,
The soul that cries as to its God,
It is a song of love and longing,
A song of love and longing.

It is but a moment--and you do not believe
That all this is idle talk at all:
That a smile, a wave upon the dark night,
Comes lightly out from a baby's hands.

The nightingale, in rapture trembling,
Sighs as she warbles the chant,
"I cannot lift my head to thee,
For I have sunk beneath thy feet."
All night within the chambers deep
The Baron watches his daughter bright,
As his great son watches the daughter white.

With love in his heart
At such a lowly spot,
He would not dare to look out of his eyes,
For, with the same grace, his spirit went above
To meet his loved one.

For there, within a hollow hollow shade,
The wild winds, with a hollow bow,
And through the air, a shaft of silver,
Struck out at last the child of night,
The pride of all the wandering men,
The joy of all the wandering maids,
And of all the life in them.

But first I saw a daughter of Latona,
Spartan, beautiful as a goddess,
Striving in her beauty to become
Beauty's own image; and wondering what
Did Latona care that she was dressed so
So fresh, so fresh in all her garments and her hair?
But now, I know, I love to think of her
When I behold her walking in the streets.

I'll say that I do not love thee. Thou art so kind
And gentle, that my words would speak less well
If I could only speak thy praises more clearly.

This is a moment, and must not be called
A momentary bliss, save for the pulse
That is not quick enough for the heart of care;
Therefore, like a sick soul shut in a shrine,
And waiting to be opened by a flame,
Poured forth love, and beauty, and life.

When the summer gale is past,
And the birds are at rest,
In the dewy glades I lie,
And am content to rest.

Here is the sunshine of the hour,
When love should shine out on me!
When the first kisses of my life
Are mingled with the dew!
Ah! what an epoch of happiness
This heart will take, when all is still.

Then, as he rose and kissed her,
With double joy he blushed, as though
Thrilled with new life, as though
At times the angel's eyes were closed;
But, now he stood apart, and kissed her,
And with double joy the Lady
Become a maiden of his heart,
And lo! the starry skies
Gleam with joy from his kiss.

He comes not back to me but to me alone,
In the happy land I love,
Where the sunshine and the shadows grow wild;
Where all the winds have found a home,
And the zephyrs their little home here.

O, how happy in the sight
Of these rosy virgins I’m wooing!
For there’s nought like a beauty, man,
To be wi’ her as I wor loving!
She’s young as I am—I dar like to say—
A happy little doll, I hope,
That Ráma will send me soon.

From the green woods that I love to climb
Down to where the mountains spring,
In the golden sunshine I stray,
While round the wide dales where I rove
O'er the banks of Allan Water.

'When we had left,' said Little John,
'This afternoon I don't think of it,
Little John he did call and say
That his wife was ill,
Little John said his wife was sick;
'If I say,' said Little John,
'I will make my daughter dance.

I do not love _any_ place
Save in the little choir
Of modest music, that is made
For modest souls, or modest;
Where'er they tread, they sing and play,
And they smile and sing, and they smile and play,
As if their eyes were drawn out,
Or some simple little thing.

I cannot tell you how my heart
Tremble throbs with eager longing;
And, from its restless soul, I hear
A blissful sound of love's own.

_Adam._ While here I live, _that_ far away,
Here is a spot of still water;
Though not a tree, yet a dale;
And there is one who seems to be dwelling--
His mother, her little lamb,
Who in this childish place,
My darling darling lamb, lies sleeping.

Let not the soft kiss of love destroy,
The kindly touch of a parent's hand;
Give back the bliss to all thy faithful soul,
And give back heaven to me!
In the sweet calm of morning,
Like the soft moon above,
Upon a starlit lake,
In the dewy glade,
Fairies their silver feet;
They laugh, they sing, they run,
They dance, they wheel, they wheel,
They bend, they twine, they twine,
They twine and twine and wear,
For the dear lily is fading;
The dew is in the rose,
And the rose is in the dew.

Thee bring me thy harp and my lyre,
And bring me the music of thy songs,
And bring me back to life again,
While men of earth and skies are at rest.

What may'st thou now, sweet? what is't then?
Sweet! what ails our youthful yearning?
The sun to earth, the wind to heaven,
Will soon make up its gloomy way,
And melt all cares that mourned so long,
With smiles from the boy-bells of May.

And all, like stars that shine across a garden,
With tranquil eye and tranquil mouth,
The day is over, my child, and the day is come,
And the song is finished and gone, my heart.

There are three gentlemen--in good faith I am bound to do them--
The eldest of them--as his eldest son is called--his daughter
All three gentlemen--in good faith I am bound to do them;
Their names--I will pronounce them _Sir Richard's_ daughter.
