His brow was like a cloud,
His shoulders all black and red,
And his shield was like a cloud,
And his helmet was like a cloud,
And he weighed like a man in his desire.

He gazed on her pale with a shudder, and swore:
"Oh God! I should not hide from you--O God!"
As he gazed, and kissed her on the cheek,
He heard her crying, and knew not how.

The youth to Vulcan the victor eyed,
And spake in words like these (his eye the shade inspires)
"What care I for my children if such spoil be mine?"
Then from his hand the trembling god withdrew,
And from his feet a spear he took, of wondrous size
Full bright, bright as flame, the forehead of a god.

My bosom felt the sharp cold shock,
My blood like ice-curdled snow,
My heart like a torrent sped--
My heart like fire did freeze.

The very hounds that dart that dart the deer
Out of their hole beneath the sheaf
Sore shivered beneath the tread of the wind.

A thousand thousand moons must she keep!
And every hour I must watch the stars
Move trembling round her frame, trembling in the light.

"I will never get rich-sought goods cheap,
Nor see a rich foreigner take my goods,
Nor have my wife to take them home,
Without begging--or, as they said,
Begins stealing.

When all the senses are calmed
Now I am free and clear,
And you, who guard me, know
My spirit still is young;
And you, who watch me, think
I have found a way.

What profits thee, then, this world of woe
Which Fortune dost unclose?  Dear son of me,
Let not the fetter'd tyrant on thy side
Expel thee, nor with thy conquering might
Give me the power to live, and to die.

The stranger's journey is done,
And I am ready to go to your house,
If you and I can arrange it well.

Nor let us now the youth and our lady-in-law
Tarry on here, where mighty TULLY once stood,
TULLY, a towering, grey, savage bull,
And a great bull; and the bull fled not hence;
The lady, too, fled not hence.

When first they journeyed here I heard the story told,
At seven years old, on foot of a stranger tribe.

I'll take my place on the cannon's mouth,
In its deep, silent valleys,
Where all is peace:
On the cannon's mouth you'll hear the bugles blare,
The bugles' note, the bugles' shout.

With her hands to her son the queen addressed:
"O name of joyous child of noble birth
That ever fretted on thy native soil! and know,
Of all thy fair sisters; oh, I have heard!
That, all your children, that are born to wed,
May not with their fathers, the queen their fear deny:
But stay, since she will no more endanger thee;
And, lo! thy future wending, shall no less harm
Thine own, than the dire events which precede it.

On a day when love soothed me for the dead,
I would be my own guard and my native shore;
And from the night I'd watch the sunrise grow,
As a new moonbeam through a drowsy mist
Stands on its lonely orb of gold.

Oh, how it feels to feel
The very day-glow of his brow,
And the quiver of his brow!
For, like a wounded lion,
Upon his wounded prey,
Doth the red hunter's heart thrill,
Because he sees the hounds of France
At the red hunter's door!
And the hunter sees, and dares not stay;
But, as he turns, the hounds do fly;
And the red hunter's heart beats thick and quick,
When he hears the hounds' calling and sights.

Ah, when his task is done,
Let me not fear--ah, I'll do--
Let me not look at you,
Stray not into your bed,
In the sunlight's lap,
In the darkness's deep dream--
Oh, hide yourself from me,
In the night,
With me.

It was a place, O friends,
Where your fair face was laid;
And your bosom swam
Beneath the shady dell
With the stars' emerald fire.

Then as an avalanche of snow
Swept down upon its path,
The hunter's eyes grew pale and long,
He saw the giant bulrush growing,
And saw the giant bulrush growing,
In its misty mists a glimmering,
Till it seemed to glide by.

“Now woe for the Greeks, and for Ilium’s vale,
When Ilion’s conquering might is o’ercome,
And thy fatal dart falls silent on the ground
“Stand fast, your weapons ready and fast:
“Safe the first and second javelin kill;
“Nor is a single life so precious as this,
“Shield nor weapon. O speed thy way!”
Thus spoke the chief, and on each other led.

I see thee in a far corner,
With a stealthy stride, and a trembling soul:
I know thou, Dear, who should'st not fear
That I should come near thee!
I know thee.

In the midst of the fierce fire they stand
With hands unsullied, as the godhead stood,
And like an arrow shot forth to cast
Its arrow at the giant king.

He saw that awful sight,--a frightful rout!
He rushed,--rushed on the startled throng!
He fell; the host fled--in panic fled;
Beneath his burning armour lay.

But if it come to this, and if not at all
Whose presence is the Master of the Universe,
Let us meet it in this Universe,--and its parts
Be equalized with ours.

But that he had so much to say, his words
Made me tremble, as though he were dead:
And that the heathen, who should know,
Should find such things of him in hell.
