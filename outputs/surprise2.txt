As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,
When plundering herds assail their byke;
When "Catch the thief!" resounds aloud,
While eager "Ponder the screener's guess"
Wi' monie an eldritch screech and hollow.

Thou gav'st me leave to do:
Thou give'st me the chance
To steal thy dear heart,
Thou meane the recompense.

They say the Lion and the Lizard keep
The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:
And Bahram, great Hunter, rides o'er all the plain
O'er all the tortuous Stocks that slip
Round Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:
And Bahram, great Hunter, rides down the tortuous Stocks.

He is a wild magician,
Who takes up the air and vanishes
As though his name were Nature's own,
And that it were Nature's own prompting,
That he should leave school in such a way.

But there is nought here to reprove:
The eternal springs to the sea
Are meager, and all are void of hope;
And I would leave the world at large
Unless the sun came out again.

Then there was a sudden pause, as a sleep
Envelop'd the brain, in some mystic frame
To the touch of a magical hand.

Who the fathom of Nature bears
Her plumes of purity like the air
Of all the rest; the world, yea, the skies
Shall vanish as her perfumed feet
Peer closely and closely, till, through
The heart of youth, she springs
A soft, languid purity to the earth,
A sparkle in the twilight, a light in the skies
And sparkles in the stars' fiery depths.

Her cheek is golden as stars, her mouth is red,
And, behind her chin, a young red squirrel gurgles,
The small red dog's play-dead.

He has said--and I shall retort in writing,
That my attacks on him are excessively strong,
And, in his own estimation, are not at all injurious;
But now he offers some clever sum of salt,
And tells me, at the first glance, that it is exactly what
he is thinking of.

Her voice hearkened and her footfalls beat,
His heart beat quick; her hand she took
Her pearly bosom; his blood rushed up and down,
And sweetly he said: "Nymph! art thou there?"
His lips she took and kiss'd, his blood ran swift.

He had but one wish, a thoughtless one,
A wild dream to pursue, to guess,
And that was all that he planned.

The sudden hush
Dropped the sound of a drum,
The wild surge
Fell back, as swift as a wind-song,
Like a bird's wing.

What is it to be dead, and to be young again?
Why, what surprise then is it to see
How many young men you have killed? and what alarm?
Since you were young and a man of God,
And I know that young Adam loved you, I do not know;
Yet, young Adam, all mean young men,
You must have thought when you struck out on earth
You would find favor with the Father.

Thy smile is less bright than mine when it's wild,
But I will catch thee far more still as they;
And I will catch thee of all thy wild things
Thy soft laughter brings back to me, more than thee
In songs like these, more wild than any wind.

When her soul had rest and rest, and a breath had ceased,
To wake up, and to think, to pray, and to pray
And to remember the past and the present.

O then, ah me! How different are these memories,
And strange how they're born?  Are they images?
Ah! no pictures can tell them apart!
I leave them here alone.

"Oh! then," he said, "to-day!"
And he trailed off suddenly
Out of sight of all the world.

For e'en o' this very day,
I wad not guess, as o'er I wad blazed,
How drear the hills were strewn,
And how wide the leal
An' spread wild about,
An' leavened me frae the banks,
When e'en days were young--
Frae mony an' mony me.

When, ere she left the cave, the crimson-bell
Rose faint in the lilacs, her master passed
Over her to the palace maid, who sat
Just above the tree for to take leave;
When, by turns she seemed to understand,
He had lost her to the forest maid.

The night wind whistles through the branches,
The rain drips from the branches,
The wind skims the branches bare;
The wind trundles through the lattice,
The leaves untended untame,
In the sun at noon is streaming,
At noon is up and singing,
The bluebells are shrill and the bluebells are shrill.

“Now shalt thou see and believe,
That if thy will be done,
My heart be made low
And thy will be done for ever,
My bosom full shall be laid.”
So said Robin to the Knight:—
“If thou art not good to me,
What will it be to take a lance?
Robin saw the knight in the middle,
The lady whom he had sent to meet.

It was the winter wild,
And the breezes were wet;
My sister came into my room
Wearing gowned hat and grey hood.

But still, while they're up and running,
The breeze will break and blow the blue;
And a wild gale will force the bay from me,
That will not let my voice be heard.

And with the wild Baltic's free waters,
The land of our dreams is ours;
Our wild Baltic's free waters,
The land of our dreams is ours.

We see him sit alone--his eyes fixed
On some wild and glancing sea--
As though his soul, as yet,
Had once breathed its last kiss
Upon him that he now enjoyed.
