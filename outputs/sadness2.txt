In vain my lips are sealed: in vain
Are tears the only savour,
To chase the dogs away!
My hands are ice; my heart is cold:
My heart is cold, O my hands!
But the darkness lies around me,
And the silence lies around me
That the dog can bite no more.

"So thou seest, that here among the pine-trees
There, a lowly and lowly dwelling, appears
A rosy Eden where the bee-fruits meet,
"So that when the winter winds arise,
As from their boughs, the ferns and flowers
Meet, and the spring-torments are moisten'd
With a new colour, that like the night
Dampens all the senses, that seem the same.

I pity the woman who caused it;
A wretched wife and young,
And a helpless infant
Who in the street is bound,
Who could not drive away it.

At the sound the door opens wide, and, hurrying onward,
Past the hall, I see it through; and hurrying onward,
The dark-haired lady with her babes is nigh,
Who, gathering dust, looks about; with a heavy sigh
She looks for some answer: and, to my astonish'd eye
Confusion makes the feeble stammer fall.

For, if any wish she had
That he was mine, I would not have it so.

I feel my country's heart beating: thrice to weep
A brother's death, thrice to weep for him gone.

The very word must needs be spoken, when we begin
To grieve that we cannot speak. But what is naught so small
As that which once we used to say?
Perhaps we should tell the reason why we weep,--
And give it up to you, who know us well.

For you, dear heart, so lone and worn and weary,
Hear me, and the silence dies,
That still I think you must come near me,
And not so be blest.

And now it is night, and we are in the wood,
Locked in a wood of twisted leaf,
Under a wide, dark, unpeopled blue sky,
Where no stars, no voices, no waves come down.

"Ah! why," says the captain, "so long,
Is the bark of this vessel idle?
So late is her mission, O dear,
Let her speak and leave me free."
As for his fellow-mew, he had no more to say,
But only said, "He has spoken, he will stay;
And I'll have him here to-day, till night shall come."
But he never spoke, nor did he think they
Gazed through the gloomy darkness and the blackness.

"_Let your hands be strong and your feet be strong,
The winds are never weary,
The woods are never weary,
Let your hands be strong and your feet be strong,
And the wood is never weary,
But you will have to go and rest,
And the pain never weary,
And the suffering never weary.

I saw it--I saw it too--and yet I feel
A qualm in my spirit as I behold
The dim, flickering figures that steal and fall,
The murmur of waterfalls that drip
Through the tarnished walls. And my own heart forgets
The pools I've walked by on the river-side,
The cold, damp pools where the sunbeams die
And ghosts on the river-side crept by.

The very sunsets of the day
Brightened as I rode in the west,
And all the roses in the garden
Rose as the moon came down from the East
And lit the roses as she went down to the West.

The trees were shaken, and the branches shook,
And wild bees flew from copse-lilies tall,
And the cuckoo sung in the wood.

In a small, yet loving room,
With a broken mirror in it,
A lily I lie,
And a heart that withers in decay,
Its charms must fade away.

Then spake one: “Alas, if I were monarch
Of this sad world,” he said, “would I fall,
And give thee as a grave a goldenrod.

O, the grief, the despair,
The anguish, the bitter pain,
Why do ye weep, my Ráma,
And weep so wildly at my woes,
That even now, at length, the Gods
Hasten to meet your weeping and your woe?
I, too, my queen, am desolate,
My prince, not yet forlorn,
In sorrow and sorrow all my heart.

His widow and his orphan was she,
And all the rest, his widow and orphan,
To the blackened ocean he returned;
Hiding, with little care, in the waves,
The lily-cups in the boat;
Or swam with the sea-weed in the pool,
Till the winds were cruel to his anguished sight.

But when it is all said and done,
When all is said and done,
That's the last call o' the bell
That will clear the air
For those who are calling.

Then, as his eyes from their wat'ry watcher fell,
The Child, with trembling fingers moved
His lips, and with the pleading of his voice
Strove to clasp the mother, weeping.  "Nay, child,
"Nay!  My father, I do remember well:
He saved me from a broken, captive heart;
And, as for myself, I shall remember well.

But one day, as I wandered through some dark
haunted forest, the night-wind blew in
the still, cloudy air; and, haply, I
heard something, hark! and then a wail, as if
of some dire affliction; from trees and grass,
the sound was still, and the forest was still!
Ah! how I mourn for the departed!
And I sobbed 'Ah, God! God!' then wearily
at the last word, 'Ah, God!'
and fell into a swoon.

Thence to our lot and our lot again
A thousand lives will have cost, alas!
To bury the son he left behind
And give his ashes to our heirs.

The dark green lane of my soul is like the little garden between
the trees where the dew is falling, falling,
And the flowers are falling in the dark and they make their
bottom shrilly;
They are falling and they are weeping with their fresh, freshness and decay.

And while he was silent on this earth
The tears he shed fell down like rain;
And like a rain-cloud the moonrise
Grew full of flowers and of flowers.

They say that in the blue-sea's boundless blue
Sea-folk, known as "Hawker Peeks," are wandering;
They call their little skippers the Blue-sea Hues;
For their hearts are blue with their little waves,
And their voices far out on the far blue-sea are;
But the blue seas say that in the blue-sea dwells.
