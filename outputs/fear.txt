And as one leaves the village of the Hun,
Or in his mountain retreat, near Sakhnin,
He hears the shouting of the retreating band,
And starts to run to meet his destiny.

Not a coward, not a coward but a traitor!
His will would be the whole world fearing
The coming of God alone and all his laws
Stroke in his heart with a whirlwind of shame and despair.

My father's grave I remember well, and still
I pray my dear Genevieve to keep
My boy from any mischance which
Hallow him in his lonely sleep.

I cannot be a prisoner of the sea,
Whom all must obey;--but--the ship will still
With a man, who's afraid, and is anxious
To take his ship to safety.

So far from my home I have stayed all day,
So far from home my wife has gone,
For I have talked to some of my tribe.

It will not change, at all, my youth or my will,
The change of the wind, or the changing rain,
Nor will my memory of deeds change;
In life I shall bear the torch of the world
That burned for me till I went to die,
And the world that gave me pleasure as my own
Through sorrow and fear and sorrow alone,
And the wind that made me half dead,
Or turned me from my youth to youth as the moonlight
Of twilight, that I know, and who can tell?
I will not change, at all, my youth or the will
The life I must live for.

I sat with a group of friends and a group of people,
Then we turned up the heat to make ourselves comfortable,
And we smoked together. And yet I still don't think we went out
To smoke together, anyway; it would beest,
But I know that we are all very tired of talking together,
And we are all very tired of thinking how to make ourselves better.

But who shall guide thy doom, or dread him?
With him or him alone? Famine and despair,
With him or him alone? He shall never fear
Nor ever leave a wretched man behind,
And never kill a poor soul.

“Why, oh, thy little darling, these?
Let us not fret; our darling is still,
And the watch-fires are still,
And the birds have fled away.”
They shouted. A dragon sprang on its guard,
And round about him spread a cloud.

I saw the lightning flash and the flood
Smash the water-slopes in bright lines,
And my ears were ringing with the thrill
Of the blackened pike.

They say to the flying duck,
"Do not harm, they say, nor fear you.

But no more.  Thus, on a shivering day,
She comes to me, and I hear her speak:
"O happy land! to see you here!
My heart is full of sorrow,
For the fire of love hath kindled
To lead thee to the grave.

Ah, the wild war! the raging flood!
How many have died--let there be one
Who, with their wild fury, may tame thee
Where never before the world,
Have wrought thy chastening rod!
O, what scenes this bitter war has wrought?
No less must I know
The sorrows of all my heart!
I watch the vale of blood
Streaming down the mountains,
The wild billows of death,
The fierce winds that haunt the sea!
These, when, in the midnight,
The storm-wind rends my tent,
All the storm-winds do so echo,
Are heard, in accents of terror,
The cries of one of these war's dead.

Yet, to-day, as I walk through the park,
Through the dale, and the jay, and the marge,
I hear the rustling of horses
In the grass.

Thitherward, from the cliff,
The flying hawk I heard
That fled the lightning,
Whose glare it doth quench:
And so did I, still afraid
To fly.

She's a maid, and he's a knight; and the maids all
Have his looks, and she's very much averse to war,
That she should be such a bad influence to his health,
That at a little talk with him one day she
Will change all her plans, to suit herself well,
And make him look up at those very ladies who stare.

What then, that on the way to the town they should go,
Could not they not see the flying of the flying lance
Amidst the tumult? could not they see the steeds
Swiftly coming forward and flying on every side?
To guard their camp the Franks have recourse to.

The giant to whom each warrior leads,
From a thousand-line-long bard comes,
And spake: "Behold my brother, who has betrayed
My lord with thy life, and in thee with his blade!
That I must not be avenged by men less,
And thus that these men I bear to your lordship!"
Himself he spake, and smote the tyrant away.

Oft, and then, as if in thought's turmoil he tried,
With furtive heart to break the frame, he shook,
And the darkness fell upon all:
Nor, he pondered, could he, but, at the least,
By the force of heaven restrain his frantic rage:
But when he saw that the terror in him
Loudly quailed, and in his bosom filled,
His senses, not knowing, to his God he turn'd,
And, as if the fire would not consume his soul,
He turned to look, lest some hostile power
From behind should be tempted into his aid,
And should himself, without his own, himself make the death;
This too the Lord of Darkness to prevent,
So fell the monster, when, at length, from out his hand
Unhappy he drew his weapon.

But I knew not whence it came, I thought,
To the desert, or the sea, or to a sea.

He saw his old foe, and said to her:
"My son!  Ráma is a king now,
And of that realm dwells my foe.

I'll be glad to die on the battlefield!
Oh, for what you have done to me,
I'll pray you put your life away!
We shall live, the war will break out,
The sword of the world is gone,
I'll be thankful to die on the battlefield,
Thank God for that.

Then, behold, a serpent,--a serpent of woe,
He made of many a soul to flee
From the tyrant, and fled from hell,
From the father of all evil.

But thou too shalt escape me, who live not
In danger, who, in the hour of need,
May be led astray from my home,
Thy presence and all thy care,
And thou too shalt perish, who died
In vain for me, my God.

The Lord was gracious unto thee,
Thy will will I told,
That whoso is wise
Should know the law and obey it.”
The Lord said: "Behold, I give thee power
To lead my people in their paths."
He willed me.
