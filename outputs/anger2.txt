But when the evening had past, and a light,
A blaze of sudden light, lit to his right,
Blazed at his left, and at his right that glare
Plunged right, and staggered left.

"Now that the great General's death shall have been o'er,
Forget thy proud disdain of all that thou art wroth,
Forget thy pride; thy hatred to me remain,
Forget thy scorn of me and all that I am,
Forget thy jealous hatred; and with all thy train
I am come to bring thee into this commotion,
To give thee some excuse to follow thus the lead.

'Tis nothing but madness, like the madman
Who, in the madman's way, goes down stairs blind,
And then, screaming, "Gang, gang!"
To the man beside the stairs.

I am not jealous; but this does vex
My heart so full of misery that I cannot stop
From angry thoughts.  This brings me relief,
And a painful torment; and I
Am content to part from thee alone.

So saying, from a spacious cell,
She from the city made her way;
Which gall'd him, in spite of all his train,
Into the depths of his misery.

This argument is based upon a line in a later Homer
in the "Ring" between Saturn and his son, Jove.  The word is an
incongruous adaptation of an old Homer by Burns on the island of Lampus.

There is not one among you,
Without a party,
Who does not know each other.

They all disperse into a blaze of light,
Where the haughty prince of Bechlaren
Shows the battle raging on his mighty shield;
On his charger they gallop, and on their reins they bear;
From off the shield themselves they dash, and, from below,
From the reins they dash like battle-shout,
With their great weapons they dash, together they press:
At the king they shout as they leap the spear.

For such is the spirit of every struggle,
And only in darkness can light find the end
Of all lives:  what is life?
What are the joys of strife?
What can avail to mortal men
Their life in death and misery?
What avail to mortal man
The strife of waking eyes?
What avail to mortal man
The waking dream of waking dreams?
Whence is thy strife?  Is life?
What avail to mortal men
When each lives as the sum
Of all lives and death is the sum?
Oh! God! what avail to mortal man
When each lives like the sum?
Whence is thy life like the sum?
Whence is thy strife?
It is thy death and it is thy death.

"And now this is our life," she said, "and you
See how it was, from the first:
I was your slave, a woman,
A wanderer through regions round.

Ah! if, in vain, I stand to breathe,
I, by the soft touch of these hands,
And dare to move with soft repose,
Alone will find you soon in safety:
For though it strive not to smite,
And yet it smiles, and yet it sleeps,
And, for the love of love, at last
The tears shall cease from flowing.

And, on her breast, the purple veil of morn
Lay, o'erwove the red and gold of life;
And the purple veil o'erwhelmed the green.

To make man, who toil and strives,
Have honour, or fear to blame;
Because the fault in some cause is past;
And therefore from his better nature springs,
Less honourable befalls him.

My little bark now I'm bound upon it,
And I can't move it, but I can hold it,
And that will give me freedom from being left."
Then said he, "You're free to bear this gait.

"Might as well have married us," says Hiddigeigei,
"Had we lived longer together, I we'd have married again."
"O'er their lands it never occurred to me to write a
suitors letter," Hiddigeigei replies.

Then the lively Lemminkainen
Thus began his fiery speaking:
"Since we in battle fell
With the brothers of Wainamoinen,
We have heard the hero of the Northland,
He called his warriors to battle,
And he spoke the words which follow:
"Our task now is completed,
Our work o'er is finish'd,
Our battle is won,
Our victory done.

If you do not, do not listen to me,
I am sorry, I do not blame you,
For the fault is mine."
And Ráma smiled, and he spoke the words which follow:
“Haste, my beloved! I am sorry for my words
And words of blame. If my words are bad
Do not condemn them, go and wash their hands
From the sins I have done.”
They stretched out their fingers in the cold
air,
And when the saintly fingers were laid
Foremost of the grass,
Ráma knelt there and sobbed.

And, when I reached the bridge's foot,
A glance from out the valley showed,
Like a lightning streaming from the pole,
A fiery meteor that cleft the height.

When I looked up and left him there,
And, as I left him there,
My heart kindled like a flame;
And, as I passed,
Nothing changed at all.

The voice which this voice reserves to you is mine,
And, if you wish to speak to me, please go and read
The contents of my Letter to you."
So said; and, as the cur and friar had heard,
He spoke: "There are others far and wide
That follow my footsteps; e'en such are indeed,
As may well have been the cause wherewith to be;
And now you too, my friends, must correspond.

"I'll drink the keg and eat the bread an' drink the cup an' the bread an' the gill,
There's six days left till my mother's there,
And then I'll hang 'em o'er my neck till I'm cold."
And she stood there with her seven children in a row--
All gazin' on, all gazin' out,
With a hush an' a yell an' a yell,
An' a shout an' a call.

For three whole years we've been training
In battle and on the field;
But now--my first concern is--
My only concern is to make our sport
As safe as we possibly can.

Let me see a herd of deer, with spots of slaughter,
And horns of slaughter, with spots of slaughter."
"For he knew who had been the murderer of the maid,
And who had slain, by his own deadly force
On a maiden's life was forfeit; he thought her dead
If living he should find, by his own death distrest
A more just death. But still he loved her more than he loved
The maid of that sweet day, to him so near.

The mighty king, Raghu’s son, from the height
Came down, and at his head reproach
Of Sítá’s king and of the sons
Of Vánar, straightway address'd him thus.

When at the battlements they are fighting,
On their swords, their iron lungs, and their
Spurs, the fighting men stand
Below the fighting men and shield the spears.
