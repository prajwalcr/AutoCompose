No pride that can rival her beauty
Her radiant features with hers;
No pride that can rival her song,
No pride that can surpass her eye.

The beautiful garden that once so bright
Grew for me again,
And now I'll go back and kiss you in the old days,
Till the rain comes in all the roses,
And the world comes laughing with laughter.

How can you suppose
A man can be
A lover and the only one of your kind,
Yet so, so dear?
Who should not be of all lovers?
Who can you not love?
The rose, the rose with its sweet perfume,
The rose with its fragrant odors.

The little daughter, with a rosy face,
And a dainty hand,
With a soft and smiling air,
The little sister wore a cloak of white,
But no one thought to look or think
On the beauty of her features;
A little girl, and a little daughter.

O, if thou mayst not love me so!
How much more shall I care, and how much more
I hate thee?
Love, when love gives thee birth,
And faith the dearest prize,
Give me such love as thou canst give.

The moonlit clouds
By her love
Are gathered in the mist;
She's the moon with the nightingale;
The sun with the glory of May;
Hull up with the ravenous raven,
And the swift-swan billows
And the long-hidden lightnings
Of the midnight hours.

Oh, how I wish that they could have lived for you
To see us live happily together,
And laugh as we walked by.

How should a mother's love keep a baby
From the care of her darling? The answer is this:
"A mother's sweet love in baby days
Is the mother's kiss."
You think that while a boy may roam free,
Yet a boy may die a boy.

"Then, if by chance," or some natural way
That pleased her, she made a desperate offer,
"To purchase some new and fine dress,
With a handsome and a handsome face,
The whole sum she needed."
Then they left the table, and went homeward,
Till at dawn they found another,
A young person of very delicate mould,
Fitted for laborious tasks.

It's a joy to think, it's a bliss to think,
And a wonder to think it all over,
And a joy to ponder the whole day
Because of the rain, so you can,
And because you love the place and the day.

A baby's a clown, an ox's a sprig,
But I see his face I never saw,
I see his eyes, but he doesn't move,
I never see his mouth, but his feet,
But the baby's a clown.

Oft had they been aflame a flame of friendship--
An o'erpower'd youth's fond memory could burn,
And such a beauty would be theirs!
Their hearts, as sweet in their hearts,
Were ever at pleasure, as though in fire;
But never so much at ease in youth's sight
As their sense of mutual friends may give.

And though the world's been aye bereft of love
And plenty,
Yet, e'en now--the child of the hour
Will wake with a sigh,
And in that dim hour will dwell,
While Heaven's wide empire warms the earth
Like a mother's tears of joy;
While all the world will blossom free
To give the gift it gave to thee--
To make thee its friend again.

It is, I think, the fairest and most pleasing thing in Heaven--
To go out into the garden fair and young and glad and bright,
And sit at the boughs, and read in the sunny light how
The children sing and the little birds sing.

_Merry, merry, merry, merry!
Merry may its flowers be
That blossom round the hill.

All the young and old, and all the old and old,
Did love to make merry sound;
Every one they loved to hear,
Was very glad.

'Tis thus with joyous and hopeful eye,
The child of God, with the gladness of his breast
Looks back on the blissful dawn of childhood.

Thou art the fountain's flow'rs and the stream's draught,
Thou art the fountain's fountain's opal,
Thou art the fountain's fountain's clear,
And thou art the fountain's fountain's bright,
And as thou wast before
Shall it my praise be thine.

To take her by the hand, and kiss,
And see what looks on her eye--all
Like sunshine to me!
She is just an angel, that can smile
And love me!
Her voice is something of love;
A prayer of mercy,
And something to be prayed upon,
A love that is sweet and deep,
And kind and true;
A faith I know, and love that is true,
And true again.

"The little daughter of Hiawatha
Was sitting with her mother
In the garden of the house,
And a little child
Played among the flowers,
And a bird sings over the trees,
But the little child sings over the bushes,
And the bird sings over the trees.

He was very near and very near my husband's grave,
How he looked and how we talked and talked,
He was the finest man of them all at the time,
For he was the person I had never known,
A true Christian man I never heard say.

Now the children run and play, and the olden days
Fill the air with love and the young are with tears,
And they hear the little lambs and be
Told that they will grow old.

"Tune--"_O love and laughter._"
Oh, dear, my baby, sing to me as
You did yesterday!_"
_O love and laughter._"

For she is her mother's child;
And she, my beautiful darling,
With her sweet voice is glad;
And all her days of rest
Are spent with you and me.

When thou art dead I have no more
Temptation to sing thy last farewell:
The wintry sky will shake thy sighing breast,
And the sunshine, on thy limbs, will glow.
