So this is my heart,
That here it is, this is my spirit;
My right hand, my left hand,
I see this now;
My right hand, I know;
But the right hand,
I know not why.

I am sorry, I fear,
For a woman, without thy care,
You will never be free:
The world has changed all for thee--
A dream of the past--
A dream of the past.

But when the battle of Eurythmics took place,
A host of fierce warriors, led by Trojans,
The chariot of Hector, with many a host
Sparkles that were of Troy and Greece,
Were scattered over the plain, with the Greeks
The ramparts of the Greeks, and the ships that follow;
And since their prowess surpasses none else's,
But the chariot now in command of their host,
They charge, with deadly force arrayed.

Then, lo! he seemed to him to die;
For his soul could not stand
The force of death, nor comprehend
The meaning of it;
But now the light did shine
Through the broken stone,
And all the lighted earth
Was shaken, for the lighted heaven
Took hold of the formless dead.

They were three in battle, one strong and one light;
Their brains and hearts were all bruised, one with brain and heart
They were fighting in the same trench.

They're only for sport, then,
Their lives are forfeit,
And they'll never win again."
But she laughed, and laughed again,
And she was quite sure,
"You're a great Miss."
"Miss Jane!"
She looked over the little table
And looked over the table again
And said, "Well done, Miss Jane!
I guess this is your last bout of your life,
And I Miss Jane has lost.

Then they, with their hosts, the Myrmidons,
And fierce Polydamas, on the rampart
Of the ships, rushed forth, and to fight
In their ships the host of Argos, the great ships
Of Pergamus. They were fighting bravely,
For the Trojan brand was high,
Against the fierce Eurymedon
Of Aragorn's fleet and the main;
The Phrygian steeds of the Libyan plain,
The chariot and steeds of the Trojans led,
And the shields of the Grecians they gave,
The steeds of Greece and the Danaans armed,
As well to smite their foes as all the host:
Pallas thus in the battle cried, and with spear
Stick and chain he held the Trojan ranks high,
And the Greeks round, and the host of Aulis;
Thou, from mighty Achaia's rampart
Of the Argives, to whom to Phrygian steeds
And the Ararïans sent, smote them all with the knee,
And from that fierce fury set afresh the Achaians,
And all their hosts, as of thunderbolts the gods in fury
Of the world burn.

And though I cannot understand his speech,
I can still bear his name.

Then, he said, the Lord's son,
Hearing no man say
That thou shouldst bear the punishment
For sins thou dost not bear?
Lord, have I not counseled thee?
O, hear it from me, and ye see
That I have forgiven thee?
Hence I counsel thee: O, know that I have forgiven thee,
O, know that I have forgiven thee?
I will not deny it: for I will not deny
The grace in thy sight.  All
My prayers are without measure
Thy eyes behold.

I feel in that frame--
The old age.

Thus, from the bark I have cut,
From the root, from the tree,
Breeze out the living breath.

"Who, who, who, by his words profane,
The immortal word has deceived,
A sinner who was a good man,
But cursed by Heaven with such words!"
He spoke these words on either side;
And so he was borne thence to Hell
A lasting torment for many a victim.

Hasten for vengeance to him who fought
Lance with a deadly weapon, when he made
His steeds furious and fell, that their fate
Should be a matter of doubtful life; but he
Came to aid them as men, by the sword
He gave to them, and slew with the brazen spear;
And the proud warrior himself, with the fatal blow
Sore as the wound, he slew the fierce knight,
And slew him in furious haste; for the knight
By the sword of the strong was pierced, the warrior
Proudly fell to him, with sore grief.

When the wretch had been gazing upon the wretch with angry eyes,
'Twas she the first to meet him in a place
And saw his face changer to stone with the same eye
She said, "He is a murderer, a thief, an exchequer,
And a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief,
And a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief, an exchequer."
As he spoke these words, as they follow, a wild noise arose
And echoed in his ears and brain. His spirit became furious
By the words, and, being shaken, his soul
Received the dreadful and awful words which follow.

There I was, sitting near the fireplace with a stooping stone,
And my neighbour said:
"O senseless child, do thou well
When you're about to smoke yourself dead."
This, of course, was a joke.

The soldier stood there, thinking
Of fighting beside,
While in a soldier's tent he stood,
And the old man threw the rock
Of battle from a crag beside.

The wretch, as the tyrant,
Cried out for vengeance against me;
Then I had no choice, but to follow
Hector and Caius, who in the fields
And in the plain came to their aid.

He, who is wise, hath wrought evil deeds, and
To this end his master's anger may rage;
For the will of God is not without desire:
The good end which He shall end his trespass shall follow;
And with such is His just judgment.

No warrior to the prince’s command,
No man to his brother’s scorn,
No man to his lord nor his queen.

I know him who I am; know him who once I met
Thy dear, trusting daughter, to whom this dear brother had gone;
And, like a knight's knight of knightly service,
She was knight to fight, she was knight to wound,
And, like a warrior's warrior, she was knight to fight,
And so through her heart she bore his sword.

He who doth know, when first began,
And now doth know not; he who doth know, when he doth know,
Who doth know, when first doth know,
Who doth know, when first doth know:
Who doth know, when first doth know,
When first doth know;
Who doth know, when first doth know?
Who doth know, when first doth know?
Who doth know, when first doth know,
Who doth know?  He doth know the word,
When first doth know.

I fear that this is not the end of his spite and fornication,
Nor is it his last; but, alas! when so many have died,
In the strife which now occupies our souls and our lives,
Himself his vengeance must bring; and our fate must be
That, while thou shalt strive, and not let thy life
Determine the time, till then, let his hands fly.

She took the sledge, and at once began
To forge with a hand and with a hammer.  The shaft
Was forged from a birch bark, or from bark from a mill.

"The great men of Pohja gave their lives for the war,
And did their fair hearts to live,"--"If no one had won, they'll never say it
"Would aye be willing that this is our history!"
"It's a war we fought,"--The French said.

But in spite of all their good fortune,
The sun hath set, and I scorn the world
Who lies in the sea-border at night,
Nor does the sky seem red, but with clouds
Piercing, like an ivy on a birch root;
Nor does the world praise the sky, for there is nothing
Above the Sun or the Moon.
