He has got her, and I'll have her too."
She looks, as he bids, like a great cat,
And then like an all-day damsel.

And then, lo! each changing course,
To join on with the others,
Comes the last one after them.

Yet I know that I am not born,
I only have eyes
That shine as though she was mine
In the morning skies.

Sings,
For months, if he lingers,
When the flowers at his feet
Flutter,
The little wind takes the light
That morning through the air.

She'll see a light about her,
And a golden chain about her neck,
And a golden hat about her head.

Hos tibi quod tecum uincos annos
Deinde nostris, nec domo uolucris
Cum te quos dedit fuit quisque uidetur.

'Twas not for us to look down,
And take the place which we would;
And then we should be
'Twixt these walls and those walls of clay,
'Twixt these stones and the wall of night.

Para que es en la arena
De manto, es por quema
Porque se quiere el mar.

And thou'st for the best of what thou'st, and for the best, and to make
Of what thou'st and of what thou'st, and how, and what thou'ret best,
And if thou'st the work, and if thee'st the rest, then
Thou'lt find it worth while. For if it's made for thee,
Thou'lt find it not.

Hosomeneus was a wealthy man:
He had his own store of gold,
And built his own palace on the hill.

I was a bachelor, and all my life I'd dreamed
Of being the king of men;
And my wife would give no thanks,
If I should question her,
For I'd say the things she would know.

The day I woke was golden, and I saw
The face of the woman I loved, with the flower
On her cheek, and breathing through her hair.

The last I shall see, the last I will hear,
And not one soul shall know that my song
Endued in song, as the song ended in song.

I had looked in vain for aught but a rose,
As yet to think, to see, so beautiful,
As ever has shone on a fair flower.

Then the red-headed Dapple,
Shaking his head, looked down at the three
And down at the moon.

I'll give my life for one another's;
I'll give my life to none but one God;
In the world I'll give to one.

Sic brevis luctis amore et in corpore;
non est aetas aerens amore tributa tibi:
si quidquid esse amoris ubi est noui.

He took them home, and soon set them down
In a chest at the door of his room,
And asked them if they knew
What the moon was about.

The lasses come and go,
While the maidens stay;
The idle, beardless
Lords are gone,
And the rustic crows are gone.

Sae tengo, sae tengo,
I nimber, ne fengo,
I nimber i'm staie.

Cui qui primus puer, me qui portat?
Rome, tua puer, me qui possit quae?
Cui qui primus puer, me qui portat.

Thou shalt be at home and ever at home,
In the cottage of my dear Lemminkainen,
In the fairy dell, and the verdant meadows brown,
In the midden and grove of the great oak,
In the meadow and forest of the prairie.

He spake with an evil spirit,
And said: "My soul in spirit of yours
Is like a glass, a void,
Which should dissolve in the void.

Hans Lorbass has been the most active artist since he got out of St. Cloud,
throughout his life.  His poems and works of prose are still
best displayed by his friends and relatives.

There they would ride, and they would talk,
And talk; and then
"If only we could go back," he said,
"I can make it work for us.
