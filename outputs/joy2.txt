But come, what may not happen,
To bring this heart-throat pain?
When love and youth are one,
I'm dead, alas!
As I passed through the woods,
A wildwood I heard
Half awake, andHalf unafraid
Of all this wildwood I remember.

Then a light step to the chamber went;
She followed quickly; and as she spoke,
Gently she lifted up her voice,
And breathed the sweet air that rose from her breast.

So when her memory wanders far,
Through the still hours I think of thee,
And of thee blest is my heart,
I seem to feel that thou indeed art mine;
As if thy beauty made my heart mine
With all the wonder it doth keep.

"So the blessed angel, Wainamoinen,
Stands before thee,
And the blessed angel, Mater,
Thus the glad tidings bring;
Thus thy spirit on life's common road
Through the evil dark is swept;
Thus thy spirit on life's common way
Is crossed by the right,
Through the narrow bound of heaven,
Past the hostile toward the land,
Past the hostile to the south."
To these the old man, in his troubled heart,
Wainamoinen: "O thou seest the truth of the matter, Mater,
Since the earth is changed;
Since the change of this strange thing is overmastered;
Since change of thee, since change of heaven,
From sorrow, and evil,
Since our sun, the change of our sun, our bliss!"
From sorrow, our joy:
Joy of ours, our sorrow!
Since the star-describes, our joy!
From sorrow, our joy, our joy!
From bitter tears of joy!
From mater, our joy!
From bitter tears!
From tears of love! star!
From day!
From hoss!
From here! star! our joy!
Of blood!
From star-descending!
From the star!
From burning, darkness, our separation!
From hush!
From these!
Joy and strife!
From h

In a world of music the sea-fowls sing,
And the silken winds with wonder whist;
In a world of beauty the sun-singer utters
All that is human.

Ah, and for the love it gave
And that it craved,
What now is over?--
A dark wreath with the roses outspread;
And the sun is gone out,--and all is bright--
A light of silver over all.

"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,
Brewer of the beer of barley,
Used the beer-foam as a ferment;
But it brought no effervescence,
Did not make the liquor sparkle.

The sun was rising -- the heavens seemed
The mirrored joy that greeted him;
The grass on his shoulders lay,
The dew upon his feet;
While through the meadow, as he went,
A little mistletoe
Moved upward, hung his head,
While zephyrs wild, as in a dream,
Drew down the quiet lane.

And when the wind blew her madrigal
And blown her white arms out at my feet,
I saw her sob like a soberer,
And I saw her sob like a soberer
And I understood her soul was mine.

So to the Rhine-thorn the goodliest bards are waking,
There in his mansion the great Acacia springs;
And, to increase Pescennius' joyous fame,
With his herds he herds again appear;
To Troy Assaracus he reaps his wealth;
His fame, which rising from the world,
Is that success which shall last for ever live:
And till no change shall wake the fame again,
I'll gladly give my future to the friend again.

Thou wast the life and love of my heart,
Thou my life and my love for my wife:
I knew thee, thou my wife, at first.

The little birds that hear it sing
Can number the hours they're in;
And it cheers them all, when times are fleet,
When the little birds are straying,
And all the little birds are singing
Their sweetest song.

What though it befell upon a day,
What though it befell upon a night,
What though that in his wif thee love,
That of love doth him reie;
Me thoghte he scholde his herte duelle,
And every where he doth take a part,
Thou givest me now his supper spred:
Now lass, my doth every day take
My place on the hevene that I see,
And every where I take a part,
That I no more may make y-while do enquire.

And though I am most thankful
To have thee come to me,
I could not have thee so;
My heart was not so full of love.

But, when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat a stranger lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen fed on hay,
And kine were brought to live.

It was my Heaven's extremest sphere
To look upon that child so fair;
I looked for joy in that bright eye,
And saw him pass, as though through air
Or water were his form to me.

For every man, from year to year,
A parent's care, or parting kiss,
Sings in their music all the day,
But if love can make them long,
No need, no need thy love to stay
Or make them worth their stay.

When the glad day is done, when the tired gray world is gone,
I go to the little laughing brook that I love the best,
And tell her dat I love the best.

As with the summer sun,
When leaves are bright,
And buds are green
By meadowside-side,
The summer sun
With its rays of gold.

_Phyl._ (_who is this little man?_)
_Phyl._ (_who is this little man?_)
Ah! he'd not dream the moon would melt
In the lonely night so sweetly,
But he'd think that his eyes were dim;
That his heart would come out on a sudden,
And look at what I've been to him.

When love first awakes to his breast,
Then warms the bosom of his soul,
To join our echoes in his praise;
That mountebank then our souls may join,
And mount the radiant ranks of song.

He was one of the sad average,
The poorest man on earth,
Who spent his years and years in tears,
And never comes back again.

And they tell us ('T was a tale of a kitchen skill)
A man who bought a great estate and was pleased to eat;
When he left our country he returned to us -
For what is a good man shall not be one who drinks a porter?
For we're all a good-man who like to have a pint of beer.

But tell me true; and if too secure I loose
The rein with a friend's license, as a friend
Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:
How chanc'd it covetous desire could find
Place in that bosom,'midst such ample store
Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur'd there?"
First somewhat mov'd to laughter by his words,
Statius replied: "Each syllable of thine
Is of a charity more just and just
Than that it is of a charity.

He who nevermore can win Glory,
But for the season of his glory
To triumph is quick the change:
Blossom and blossom and sunshine
Are one and all together.
